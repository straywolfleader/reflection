How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    That's a very important and useful function(功能). Sometimes the complier 
  can't find out the bugs which is logical. we will be take some times to find
  out it. But our time is precious. Then we can use the command of diff to compare
  the new file and the old one for finding out the bugs. Obviously, the command is
  more useful somtimes than the complier.

commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

 effient. But it may be badder for new birds.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The function about that saving multiple files in one commit is more stronger
    than that treat eack file separately. We conld edit some file which is contact
    each other such as .js. So saving multiple files in one commit will more useful.
